The Question regarding task as follows:
Problem :

We are giving the data for elementary education in each state as “Elementary.csv” and the metadata for each feature is given as “Elementary explained.csv”

Analyzing the data before applying any ML algorithm or technique is an imp step.

Write programs using Pandas to do the following:

1.Print the datatype of each feature

2.Drop column by name- “AC_YEAR”

3.What percentage of the population is urban, for every state

4.For every state, print which is higher: male literacy rate is higher or female literacy rate

5.Name the states with female literacy rate greater than male literacy rate

6.Suggest the features which can be dropped. Why?

Write a program using Matplotlib and related libraries to create visualizations as shown below: 
(First 2 have been shown as an example)

1.Plot bar chart for female literacy rate for every state

2.Plot  bar chart  for female literacy rate and the male literacy rate for every state

3.Plot box plot separately for each feature, mark outliers with “red circles”

4.As per the above question’s result, which features need scaling. Why?

5.Plot heat map to show the correlation between each pair of features.

6.Plot a scatterplot for “Repeaters By Grade: Boys - Grade 8” i.e. ”C8_BR” and “Children with Special Needs: Boys - Grade 8” .i.e. “C8_BD”
